Simple extension for chrome or any browser ig that lets you add gain to youtube

# WHY?
----------------
 **- Youtube videos are often weirdly quiet, not like "oh, that's a little quiet", BUT "I legit cannot hear this with my headphones off"**

# HOW?
----------------
add a gain function that affects only youtube, it's pretty easy to see where you add more links imo (manifest.json)
